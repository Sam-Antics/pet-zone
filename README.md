WHEN I get to the landing page,
THEN I am prompted to log in to either the client side or management side of the application.
WHEN logging into the clinic side of the application,
THEN I can search for, select, and update client files.
WHEN logging into the client side of the application,
THEN I can see cards with pictures of each of the animals who are patients at the clinic.
